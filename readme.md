# Cobra (working title)

A tool for exporting and importing world map scripts in NSMBW, NSMB2, NSMBU, and NSMBUDX.

## Overview

The scripts and their commands vary between games. Documentation on them is kept in the `data` folder, mostly in the form of JSON files so that the info can be used programmatically.

The `generate_documentation` command converts it all to Github-flavored Markdown files, which are checked into the repository and kept up-to-date:

* [World Map Scripts in NSMBW](docs_nsmbw.md)
* [World Map Scripts in NSMB2](docs_nsmb2.md)
* [World Map Scripts in NSMBU/NSMBUDX](docs_nsmbu.md)
